# Abstract
*Hablemos entre Patas (HEP)* is a men-focused intimate partner violence (IPV) prevention program delivered by trained male facilitators to a group of 50 men via WhatsApp, an instant messaging application. Over 30 days, each facilitator promotes discussion of masculine norms and shares daily behavioral and skill-building challenges to improve relationship dynamics, reduce violence, and change menâ€™s attitudes towards violence against women. 

HEP is designed to impact the following outcomes: 1) men's emotional regulation and communication skills to control violent behaviors, communicate and resolve conflict; 2) men's understanding of consensual sex and communication with female partners about sex; and 3) men's knowledge and skills about finances and shared household management to reduce conflict over money and distribution of household labor. Through discrete (virtual) interactions in groups with other men, HEP offers men a community of like-minded individuals who are also seeking to improve their relationships. The group offers space and social support for men to challenge each other to change attitudes, confront patriarchal norms, and ultimately change their behavior.

We experimentally evaluate HEP by randomly assigning the intervention to half of the enrolled men. The main analyses of the experiment take place at the couple level; therefore, only partnered men are eligible to participate. We conduct phone surveys (baseline and endline) among men and their female partners. IPV and other IPV-related outcomes will be measured from female partners' responses.
